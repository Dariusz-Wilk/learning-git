		<h1>Queen: Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
		<p>
			Is this the real life? <br />
			Is this just fantasy? <br />
			Caught in a landslide, noescape from reality. <br />
			Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. <br />
			I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, <br />
			Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low. <br />
			Anyway the wind blows <br />
			Doesn't really matter to me, to me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mama just killed a man <br />
			Put a gun against his head <br />
			Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. <br />
			Mama, life had just begun <br />
			But now I've gone and thrown it all away. <br />
			Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry, <br />
			If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, <br />
			Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Too late, my time has come <br />
			Sends shivers down my spine <br />
			Body's aching all the time. <br />
			Good bye, everybody, I've got to go <br />
			Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mama, ooh (anyway the winds blow), I don't wanna die <br />
			I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
